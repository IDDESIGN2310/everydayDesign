In each unique Cohncave bowl the two perforated layers are offset to produce a moir� pattern. Cohn�s concept for a mass produced artisan piece saw the Cohncave short listed to a final group of nine designs. All short listed designers submitted sketches � except for Cohn � who presented an exquisite prototype still prized by Alberto Alessi. The Cohncave was released in 1992 and Cohn would become the first of many Melbourne designers to work with Alessi."

This uniquely Australian game involves the marking, bouncing, kicking and hand passing of a red leather ball over a large oval field of play. Teams of eighteen a side and the long game time of around 100 minutes, place large demands on the durability of the hand-stitched ball. In 1882, based on the experience of repairing the stitching to the more pointed rugby balls used for early games, Thomas William Sherrin designed a more durable rounded oval ball. The game is now faster and has seen many innovations by coaches, players and the Australian Football League, but the original ball, designed and made in Melbourne by Sherrin, remains the same."
